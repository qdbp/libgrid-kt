/**
 * Welcome to the lowliest of the low. Have to start somewhere, right?
 *
 * Our problem is as follows:
 *
 * we have a 7x7 box, with the corners missing and the center missing.
 *
 * We have as many as we want of each of three shapes:
 *   the square tetromino, worth 1 point
 *   the L tetromino, worth 3 points
 *   and the pentomino cross, worth 0 points. But we have to have at least one.
 *
 * Our objective is to use this fine library to find the highest scoring solution to this problem.
